# CSSRobot
This repository contains the source code of the CSS Robot i created using html,css, javascript and jquery elements.

# Introduction
The bot i made contains three buttons namely "Laser Eyes On/Off" , "Change Color" and "Stop Dancing" The laser light coming out of the bot's eyes toggle on or off with a duration of 0.5 seconds when we press the first button! The background colors are changed using the RGBA notation when "Change color" button in pressed and the last button is used to stop or start the dancing gif i added which slides into the screen for a duration of 4 seconds.

This project mainly uses the jquery elements and javascript commands for main functionality and focuses on the div element of the css to create the basic building block of the bot.
